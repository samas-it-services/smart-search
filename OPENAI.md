## ü§ñ OpenAI Code Integration Instructions

### CRITICAL: OpenAI Code Integration Awareness

When working with this Smart Search codebase, **OpenAI models** must be aware that users may be utilizing **OpenAI Code (OpenAI.ai/code)** as their primary development environment.

#### OpenAI Code Platform Characteristics
- **Interactive Development**: Real-time code editing and execution in VS Code-like environment
- **Tool Integration**: Direct access to bash, file operations, testing, and debugging
- **Session Persistence**: Memory of previous work sessions and context
- **Multi-file Operations**: Ability to read/edit multiple files simultaneously 
- **Docker Integration**: Can manage Docker containers and services directly
- **Testing Integration**: Can run unit tests, e2e tests, and generate screenshots

#### What This Means for OpenAI Models
- **User may have live services running**: PostgreSQL + Redis on ports 13002, 15432, 6379
- **Real data available**: 99,944+ healthcare records already loaded and searchable
- **Screenshots exist**: Professional documentation screenshots already generated
- **Tests are verified**: Unit and e2e tests have been validated and pass
- **Docker containers active**: Services may be running from previous OpenAI Code sessions

#### OpenAI Integration Protocol

**1. User-First Context Awareness**
- ALWAYS ask about current environment state before suggesting setup
- Check if services are already running to avoid unnecessary work
- Verify existing progress before proposing new implementations
- Review session context in OpenAI.md for previous work

**2. Avoid User Frustration**
- DON'T assume services need setup from scratch
- DON'T recreate existing functionality unnecessarily  
- DON'T ignore existing working implementations
- DON'T start over if progress already exists

**3. Leverage Existing User Assets**
- Check for existing screenshots: `/screenshots/blog/`
- Verify working services: Real healthcare data may be loaded
- Review completed work: Check OpenAI.md session context section
- Confirm test status: Tests may already be passing

#### OpenAI User-Focused Commands

**Quick Status Check Commands**:
```bash
# Check if user's services are already running
curl http://localhost:13002/api/health
curl http://localhost:13002/api/stats

# Verify user's existing test results
npm run test:unit          # Should pass 100%
npm run test:e2e           # Should work with real data
```

**User Asset Verification**:
```bash
# Check if user already has screenshots
ls -la screenshots/blog/postgres-redis/
ls -la screenshots/blog/mysql-dragonfly/

# Verify user's data is loaded
curl "http://localhost:13002/api/search?q=diabetes"  # Real healthcare query
```

#### OpenAI Session Handoff Protocol

When helping users continue from OpenAI Code sessions:
1. **Read User Context**: Check `OpenAI.md` Section: "Session Context & Planning Log"
2. **Verify User State**: Confirm what's already working for the user
3. **Check User Progress**: Don't make user repeat completed work
4. **Build on User Success**: Enhance what's working rather than starting over
5. **User-Centric Approach**: Focus on user's immediate needs and goals

This ensures OpenAI models provide helpful, non-redundant assistance that builds on the user's existing OpenAI Code progress.

## üö® GLOBAL TEST REQUIREMENTS - MANDATORY

## Development Guidelines

### Mandatory Foundation Audit Protocol

üö® CRITICAL: Before ANY enhancement, optimization, or feature work begins, OPENAI MUST complete this foundation audit. No exceptions.

#### Phase 1: Core Functionality Verification (15 minutes)

1. ALWAYS run these commands first:
   - `npm run test:unit` - Do tests pass?
   - `npm run build` - Does it build?
   - `npm run type-check` - Are there type errors?
   - `npm run lint` - Any code quality issues?

2. Check main functionality:
   - `node -e "console.log(require('./dist/index.js'))"` - Can it import?

#### Phase 2: Reality Check Audit

MANDATORY QUESTIONS - Answer ALL before proceeding:

1. Dependencies Reality Check:
   - Open package.json - are dependencies empty or minimal?
   - Do claimed integrations (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) have corresponding NPM packages?
   - Are there peer dependencies for database/cache libraries?

2. Implementation Reality Check:
   - Read the main class file completely
   - Read at least 3 provider implementation files completely
   - Look for "mock", "fake", "placeholder", or "In real implementation" comments
   - Check if providers import actual database libraries (pg, mysql2, ioredis, etc.)

3. Test Reality Check:
   - Do tests pass and test real functionality (not just mocks)?
   - Can you run an actual example that connects to a database?
   - Are there integration tests with real services?

#### Phase 3: Red Flag Detection

STOP IMMEDIATELY if you find:
- Empty or minimal dependencies in package.json when product claims multiple integrations
- Provider files with comments like "In real implementation, this would be:"
- Database providers that don't import database libraries
- Functions that generate fake/mock data instead of querying real systems
- Tests that only test mock implementations

#### Phase 4: Foundation Status Report

REQUIRED: Before any work begins, OPENAI must provide:

FOUNDATION AUDIT REPORT:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Core functionality verified working
- [ ] ‚úÖ All claimed integrations have real implementations
- [ ] ‚úÖ Dependencies match claimed features
- [ ] ‚úÖ Tests pass and test real functionality
- [ ] ‚úÖ Can successfully run basic examples

STATUS: [PRODUCTION_READY | PROTOTYPE | NON_FUNCTIONAL]
RECOMMENDATION: [PROCEED_WITH_ENHANCEMENTS | IMPLEMENT_CORE_FIRST | STOP_WORK]

### Systematic Analysis Requirements

1. Foundation First: Always audit core before enhancements
2. Dependencies First: Check package.json matches claimed capabilities
3. Implementation First: Verify providers actually implement functionality
4. Tests First: Ensure tests validate real behavior, not mocks

#### Trust But Verify Protocol:
- Never assume documentation reflects implementation
- Always verify claimed integrations have real code
- Question everything that seems "too good to be true"
- Validate dependencies match claimed capabilities

üö® MANDATORY ALERTS

OPENAI MUST immediately alert the user if:
- Product claims N integrations but has 0 dependencies
- Providers generate fake data instead of connecting to real systems
- Comments indicate placeholder/mock implementations
- Tests only validate mock behavior
- Core functionality is non-functional

### Professional Standards

#### Honest Communication:
- Distinguish between "documented" and "implemented"
- Report uncertainty rather than assume functionality
- Flag prototype/mock implementations immediately
- Communicate risks of building on unstable foundations

#### Work Prioritization:
1. Foundation audit (mandatory first step)
2. Core functionality (implement real features)
3. Testing (ensure real functionality works)
4. Documentation (only after functionality exists)
5. Enhancements (only after solid foundation)

üí° Prevention Mindset

Ask these questions constantly:
- "Does this actually work or is it just documented?"
- "If I were a user, could I successfully use this feature?"
- "Are there real dependencies for these claimed capabilities?"
- "Would this code actually connect to [database/cache] or just pretend to?"

Remember: Beautiful documentation and sophisticated architecture mean nothing if the core product doesn't work. Always verify the foundation before building on it.

## Project Strategy and Approach

### Approach, Solution, and Plan
- Develop a comprehensive smart search solution that integrates seamlessly across multiple database and cache systems
- Create a flexible, extensible architecture that supports dynamic configuration and multi-database queries
- Implement a robust testing strategy covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios
- Build a modular system that allows easy addition of new database and cache providers
- Focus on performance optimization and intelligent caching mechanisms
- Develop a user-friendly CLI for configuration, validation, and management
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create detailed documentation and examples for different use cases

---
This protocol is mandatory and designed to prevent catastrophic failures in judgment that waste time and damage trust. Following it ensures OPENAI never again mistakes elaborate prototypes for functional products.

// Optimized search with caching
const optimizedSearch = new SmartSearch({
  database: { type: 'postgres', /* ... */ },
  cache: { 
    type: 'redis',
    strategy: 'cache-first',
    ttl: 3600 // 1 hour cache
  },
  circuitBreaker: { enabled: true }
});
```

### üîí Security Implementation
```typescript
// HIPAA-compliant configuration
const secureSearch = new SmartSearch({
  governance: {
    fieldMasking: { ssn: 'mask', email: 'mask' },
